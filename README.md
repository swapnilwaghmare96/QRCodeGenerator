The QR Code Generator project in Python is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to generate QR codes for various purposes. QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store a wide range of information, such as URLs, text, contact details, and more. This project provides a convenient way to create custom QR codes with ease.

Third-Party Libraries: The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as qrcode and Pillow (or PIL) to handle the QR code generation and image manipulation tasks. These libraries provide efficient and reliable functionality for creating and customizing QR codes.
